#   If you have gnome-keyring package installed gnome-keyring-daemon
#   is started for lightdm by pam_gnome_keyring (package libpam-gnome-keyring),
#   but not initialized, at least in 12.04..13.04.
#
#   This script finishes gnome-keyring-daemon initialization as described in
#     https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/RunningDaemon
#
#   By default gnome-keyring-daemon provides ssh, gpg, pkcs11 and secrets services.
#   This script uses all of them, overriding existing environment. If you prefer
#   ssh-agent, gpg-agent or ksecretsservice, you need to modify the script.
